# And Perceptron
And Gate is high when both the inputs are high, otherwise it is low. As you can see in below Truth Table. In this I make a And Perceptron which is working with the given weights.

#### Languages
* Python

I used Sublime text editor. You can use any text editor.
```sh
In this Linear combination is used  wx+b=y where w is the weights, x is the inputs and b is bias.
```
| INPUT 1       | INPUT 2          | OUTPUT |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 0      | 0 | 0 |
| 0      | 1     |   0|
| 1 | 0    |   0 |
| 1 | 1  |   1 |
